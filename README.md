#NOTEMATE
## Inspiration
The process of taking notes, highlighting keywords, and generating summaries for meetings and classes is an arduous & cumbersome process. In this project, we design an end-to-end solution for taking notes, managing transcripts, and generating summaries and keywords.

## What it does
It allows the user to record and upload audio files to NoteMate, which transcribes, summarizes and organizes notes for different lectures grouped by topics and key concepts.

## How we built it
We use Google Speech-to-Text, Google Natural Language AI, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Functions, Google authentication, Gensim, Python, and JavaScript to develop our solution.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges in deploying our serverless services, creating service function chains, and integrating frontend to the backend. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We loved pitching ideas, working on their feasibility, and realizing an idea into a project. It was an enriching experience to integrate and develop an end-to-end system.

## What we learned
We learned how to maximize productivity within a short time and how to take an idea and implement it using a combination of technologies.

## What's next for NoteMate
We would like NoteMate to support mobile platforms, have better UI/UX, making summaries more meaningful by optimization the summarization engine.
